			<p>Hi, I am Gidon Frischkorn and I currently work as an SNF Ambizione Fellow associated with the <a href="https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/nec/allgpsy.html">Cognitive Psychology Lab</a> 
			at the <a href="https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Psychology</a> of the <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html">University of Zurich</a>. 
			I did my PhD in Cognitive Individual Differences Research at <a href="https://www.psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de/arbeitseinheit/persoenlichkeit-und-diagnostik">Heidelberg University</a> 
			under the supervision of Prof. Dirk Hagemann.</p>

			<p>	I am a psychometrician - that is a psychologists researching how to measure psychological traits of people 
			- focussing on the measurement of cognitive traits, such as working memory, processing speed, and attention. </p>
			
			<p> In my research, I focus on the development and use of methods for measuring cognitive processes, and individual differences in these processes. 
				My work bridges statistical research with psychometrics, theory development and individual differences research. 
				The aim of developing new methods for the measurement of cognitive processes is to obtain more direct indicators of the cognitive processes underlying observed behavior. 
				With such methods it is possible to obtain theoretically meaningful and objectively interpretable indicators for psychological processes, 
				and thus gather more substantive evidence on the processes underlying behavior.</p>
