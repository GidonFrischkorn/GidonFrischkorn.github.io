			<p>Hi, I am Gidon Frischkorn and I currently work as an SNF Ambizione Fellow associated with the <a href="https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/nec/allgpsy.html">Cognitive Psychology Lab</a> 
			at the <a href="https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Psychology</a> of the <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html">University of Zurich</a>. 
			I did my PhD in Cognitive Individual Differences Research at <a href="https://www.psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de/arbeitseinheit/persoenlichkeit-und-diagnostik">Heidelberg University</a> 
			under the supervision of Prof. Dirk Hagemann.</p>

			<p>	I am a psychometrician - that is a psychologists researching how to measure psychological traits of people 
			- focussing on the measurement of cognitive traits, such as working memory, processing speed, and attention. </p>
			
			<p> Broadly speaking, my work revolves around the question how we can measure psychological processes and individual differences therein. 
				Thus, my research lies at the inter-section of psychometrics, psychological research methods, and experimental psychology. 
				In empirical research we typically collect self-reports or behavioral data, such as accuracies and response times, from participants. 
				Yet, these do not directly reflect the psychological processes we aim to measure and investigate. 
				My work tries to address this gap by using mathematical models that describe how psychological processes interact and translate into observed behavior. </p>
