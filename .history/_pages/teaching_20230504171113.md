## Teaching philosophy
Knowledge and skills in quantitative methods and statistics provide the essential toolbox for psychological researchers as well as psychologists in applied fields that need to critically evaluate scientific results and research. More broadly these skills are becoming more important generally in our society, given the vast amount of information we have access to in our everyday life. In this, it is my aim to frame psychological methods and statistics as the basis for scientific reasoning and the essential foundation for all theoretical and empirical work in psychology. My primary goal in teaching psychological methods and statistics thus is to communicate that the statistical methods and tests bear essential meaning towards our scientific questions and are not mere mathematical procedures that provide abstract numerical indexes. To achieve this goal my teaching is focused on three primary goals:

1. Convey and exemplify the most important mathematical foundations (e.g., probability theory, sampling, Bayes theorem) that psychological methods build on.
2. Explain the logic and application of frequentist and Bayesian statistical analyses, the theoretical models they are implementing, and how they are linked to each other.
3. Link knowledge about statistical analyses to their implementation in software (e.g., R, RStudio, MPlus) to enable students to apply the learned knowledge and adapt statistical analyses to their own research questions.

Routinely my teaching also educates students about the importance of open and cumulative science by sharing data, analysis scripts, and materials. Therefore, beyond teaching students how to perform statistical analyses, I require them to document code and data so that other researchers can reproduce and understand shared code. Where reasonable, I encourage students to pre-register their research designs and share data & code for their graduation theses on public repositories such as the Open Science Framework.
