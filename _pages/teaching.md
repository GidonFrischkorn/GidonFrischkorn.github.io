## Workshops

I have held workshops in a broad range of topics in the area of *statistics* and *computational modelling* in Psychology. Specifically, I have held worksops on:

1. Structural Equation Modelling in Psychology & Social Sciences (2-3 days)
2. Introdcution to Bayesian Statistics in R with brms (1 - 3 days, depending on depth)
3. Simulation Studies to challenge intuitions about statistics and psychological theories (2 - 3 days)
4. Analyzing Data on the level of cognitive processes / Introduction to the R package: bmm (2 - 3 days)

If you are interested in including one of my workshops in your PhD or Graduate program, please contact me.

## Lectures & Seminars

Beyond the  worshops that are targeted towards advanced graduate students, PhDs, and early career PostDocs, I held courses in Undergraduate and Graduate Programs at Heidelberg University, University of Zurich, and University of Lucerne. These courses focussed on the following topics:

- Introduction to Statistics
- Introduction to Psychometrics
- Current topics in Cognitive Psychology

Typically these courses are designed for weekly sessions of about 2 hours, with additional course work for students that needs to be completed in between the sessions.

## Teaching philosophy

Knowledge and skills in **quantitative methods and statistics** are **essential tools** for psychological researchers and applied psychologists who must **critically evaluate scientific findings**. These skills are **increasingly vital** in today’s information-rich society. I aim to present psychological methods and statistics as the **foundation of scientific reasoning** and the **basis for all theoretical and empirical work** in psychology.  

My teaching emphasizes that **statistical methods are not abstract mathematical exercises** but carry **direct meaning for our scientific questions**. To achieve this, I focus on three goals:  

1. **Teach the core mathematical foundations** (e.g., probability theory, sampling, Bayes’ theorem) underlying psychological methods.  
2. **Explain the logic and application** of frequentist and Bayesian analyses, their theoretical models, and interconnections.  
3. **Connect statistical knowledge to software implementation** (e.g., R, RStudio, MPlus), enabling students to apply and adapt analyses to their own research questions.  

I also promote **open and cumulative science** by requiring students to **document code and data for reproducibility**, encouraging **preregistration**, and **sharing materials and results** on platforms such as the Open Science Framework.
